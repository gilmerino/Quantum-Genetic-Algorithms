# Quantum-Genetic-Algorithms-in-R
This repository includes three pieces of code written in the R language. Two of them are quantum genetic algorithms (QGAs): one that we call "basic" QGA, with a structure similar to classical versions of GAs, and another one called "reduced" QGA based on Grover's algorithm. The third piece of code is a simple classical genetic algorithm to compare to.

The problem to solve in all of them is to maximize the 2D function **f(x,y)=x²+y²** as a benchmark function.
