# Quantum-Genetic-Algorithms
This repository includes three pieces of code. Two of them are quantum genetic algorithms (QGAs): one that we call "basic" QGA, with a structure similar to classical versions of GAs, and another one called "reduced" QGA based on Grover's algorithm. The third piece of code is a simple classical genetic algorithm to compare to.
